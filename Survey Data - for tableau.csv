In wintertime turn the heat on. If it's summertime, turn the AC on. Start practicing monthly maintenance of the prisons cooling and heating systems. Start painting and cleaning alarm bells, day-rooms, then inmates would start feeling better about their surroundings. Assist in the up-keeping of it. But CDCR is so cheap, they refuse to hire painters, plumbers, electricians, maintenance workers. That's why the prisons are falling apart. I just went 2 weeks without all lights.","Name included

 Dear EBC:
 Peaceful greetings!
 I'm writing regarding the climate survey. I will be answering the following survey and mailing it in a separate envelope. I do appreciate you considering me for the survey. I have been to 13 different institutions. I have been to one end of the state from hot ass Calipatria to the wet Pelican Bay. It was the longest 2 day drive of my life. At this time I reside in warm RJ.Donovan where the beach area weather goes from one extreme to another. The weather here is a mess. Extreme heat to Extreme cold.

Avenal is in a region that naturally reaches extremely hot (95'-110' for weeks) temperatures in the summer. I personally do not handle the heat very well so it is an especially horrible experience for me. The housing units are equipped with swamp coolers which do not operate at 100% and frequently break down. The housing units are also equipped with two giant ceiling fans but unless you are standing directly beneath it, it is ineffectual at cooling the building overall. The dorms in the corner of the buildings constantly reach temperatures over 95', a 3 ft diameter floor fan is provided but only move the hot air around, it doesn't cool the dorm. When the building temp. reaches 95', the prison provides two 10 gal (approx.) ""Igloo"" containers of ice water once or twice a day. We used to be allowed to purchase small travel clocks with thermometers but CDCR has banned them because Inmates would continually file ""602""'s for being housed in extreme heat conditions. CDCR doesn't want us to know the temperature because they do not want to be held accountable for the cruel and intolerable conditions they force us to live in. They also don't want to pay the money that is necessary to fix the problem.
 When it comes to wildfires, Avenal State Prison is positioned next to some grassy hills. Twice in 6 years these hills have caught on fire. I've never heard of any sort of emergency plan.","Nothing can possibly change until the CDCR is reformed in reality and practice, not just on paper. Among the CDCR Correctional Officers is bred a community of apathy and ""anti-inmate"" mentality. When an officer steps out of line against an inmate, even the ""good"" officers are forced through peer-pressure and threats to go along with it. The majority of the Officers are S.O.B.s (Subpar Overpriced Babysitters). They simply view this as a job/paycheck. They simply do not care about doing anything to address any problem unless it affects them directly. Even when the rights and human dignity of an inmate is violated the officers must go along with it for fear of ""going against one of their own.""

This prison stays between 110-120 degrees all summer long. They don't run yard and won't let us exercise in the dayroom- denying us physical activity (exercise). Not that we'd want to exercise inside as it gets just as extremely hot. As well the C/Os refuse to allow us to wear tank tops in the dayroom to help stay cool. If you do, they'll threaten to write you up or send you back to your cell. The dayroom is the only place you can get a proper shower to cool down. They were forced to pass out ice one summer here because of protest from families of inmates, after an inmate passed away from heat stroke on the yard. Otherwise staff here treat ice as contraband. If an inmate tries to sneak some back the C/Os will take it if discovered. They will often search carts and inmates looking for ice. Not only do I not believe staff will help me in times of excessive heat, but they seem to do whatever they can to make it worse- including taking any extra fans they find. Also at my last ""family visit"" (over night visit) which was in August, the air conditioner broke down. I told the next officer who came to the unit. He told me I'd have to wait until the next day because maintenance was gone and they had no fans to provide us; otherwise they'd have to cancel my visit. So we had to bare it until the next day. My mother was there, she complained of feeling dizzy but didn't want to end the visit. She was 58 with high blood pressure. She died 40 days later. (All this is from here at Calipatria State Prison).","I believe this prison and others like it in extremely hot places should be closed down. I was here in 2013 and have been here 4 years and it just keeps getting hotter. I've been to 6 different prisons besides this one and the officers here seem to be the most malicious and have the most contempt towards the inmates. I've had issues here I haven't had anywhere else. It's like they do things just for the pleasure of harming the inmates, like not allowing ice, or tank tops in the dayroom, or delaying the tablet program as much as they can. This attitude is probably due to the stress they're experiencing from the extreme heat as well. 
 I also recommend they put ice machines in each block and allow inmates access to it. They should also allow inmates to purchase an extra fan in extremely hot places and/or allow us to buy a mini air cooling unit in each block, because the times I felt like my life was in danger from heat was inside the block/cell when my fan broke. 
 They also need to instruct the staff to allow clothes to help cool us down like tank tops in the dayroom or shorts to the chow hall, ect. Or even to allow us to roll up or pants (state blues) over our ankles to cool down- which they don't allow either.",

 I lived at the Ironwood State prison in Blythe, CA 92225 starting date of Aug. 30 2012 through Nov 24, 2015 [housing redacted]. Ironwood is very hot & humid in the summer.

 When an inmate is sick or have many health issues there are many concerns from smoke from wildfires, floods that could harm us, Extreme heat when the ambient is well above 90'F. Taking medication and concerns of the ambient temperatures in our cell on a hot day, maybe an inmate that has several health issues may not have funds to buy a portable 8 inch 3 speed fan from package to keep cool, that goes for extreme cold conditions. When it's cold in the 30'F outside, our cell temp needs to maintain 76' to 80' to be comfortable.
 
 Please read attached three page story, thank you.","From the attachment:
 COVID-19 Pandemic Experience 2/20/2023
 Extreme cold temperatures, extended periods, 3 pages.
 My name is [redacted]. I've been living at the Correctional Training Facility since Nov, 2015 to this present day. I would like to share my story during the COVID-19 pandemic. With-in the first week of January 2021 I experienced a headache, fever, and body aches for two days. Soon after, CTF were testing me and prison inmates for COVID-19, I tested positive for COVID-19. A few days later the correctional officer came to my door to inform me that I tested positive for COVID-19 and that I had to pack up my belongings onto a four wheeled cart. He told me to go to tent city located behind Mamoth Clinic, at that time it was called ""The White Elephant."" CTF hired an outside company to set up two tent Cities, one was located in the C yard. Another was located nearby the B yard, within the B yard perimeter. The outside company provided a main trailer power generator that later failed and was replaced by another main trailer power generator. They provided two separate trailers of private stall showers, and one trailer for hand washing stations. They also provided portable restrooms and several ground lighting systems to light up the areas throughout the whole city. They also provided fourteen eight man tents to accommodate inmates that tested positive. Also, one eight man tent to accommodate the correctional officers. Each tent had its own HVAC package systems. Some were strip heat & mechanical cooling, some were mechanical heat pump producing heating & cooling. I lived in the #8 tent for 10 days. The heating failed to keep us warm. A service man from Cobalt came out and failed to repair our system. I filed a formal complaint to the correctional officers and I was moved to another tent. That tent heating system failed to keep us warm. I asked around and every heating system failed to keep the inmates warm.
 After a week went by, a terrible storm came in and damaged the ground lighting, the high winds caused damage. The HVAC ducts, round spiral ducts on the ground level would be blown in such a way to prevent proper air flow from the package to ground level then up and connected to the tent itself. The storm lasted for several days. Raining, day and night for several days. The whole tent city was flooded with water over the mud. We ALL had to walk through the thick soft heavy mud to use the portable toilets outside our tents during the day and late at night it was very dangerous. I had to go to the boys room three to four times a night. I'm 65 years old at that time. It was very difficult for me. I had to clean my boots every time I returned to my tent. The temperature was in the very low 30' F and the heating systems were overwhelmed because the outside temperature was in the low 30'F. Several inmates were heating up water from their hot pots to try to defrost manually the ice off the condensing coil so they could get some heat from their heat pump. Many heat pumps failed to go into automatic defrost. I determined that the tent I was transferred to when the unit produced heat for 30 minutes, it would go into defrost for 10 to 15 min then it would reverse the cycle of refrigerant to produce another 30 minutes of heat then another 10 to 15 min to defrost. In the meantime whenever that system defrosts for that 10 to 15 minutes, it produced a lot of cold air in the tent. I'm a HVAC service technician for over 30 years. I don't think these systems accommodated a strip heat system that is activated when the heat pump is in defrost mode.
 In my opinion these HVAC package systems were not designed to work under very low outside ambient temperatures of 30'F. There are specialized systems to provide the necessary heat as needed when the outside temperature is very low. We needed a heating system that would provide temps of 76' to 80'F inside A TENT to accommodate eight men to keep warm. Please note: When I'm in my cell when the outside temperature is in the low 30's F my Ken-Tech fold up travel clock has a temperature indicator giving me my cell temperature when it is very cold outside. Including solid concrete walls, the temperature at this time and date, 2/20/2023 at 7:38 pm, it's a lovely 80'F in our cell. The temperature maintains usually 76' to 80' F, thank you CTF, you're the best. But fail to keep any prison inmate warm in a tent outside when it's 30'F with very high winds and SEVERAL DAYS AND NIGHTS OF RAIN. I also want to mention again the main trailer electric generator failed. I heard that the generator failed because it tripped a low oil safety control. The company didn't monitor the oil level in the electric generator compartment. Several Cobalt service technicians were called out because of the broken HVAC systems. Funny that they did fix the correctional officers heating (tent) system. Ella Baker, if there is any questions I could answer, feel free to contact me! I would be willing to help. I hope no one ever has to go through what many of us inmates went through ever again.
 Sincerely, [Redacted]
